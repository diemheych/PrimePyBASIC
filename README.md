# PrimePyBASIC
PyBASIC ported and packaged to run on the HP Prime calculator using the HP Prime MicroPython environment.
# References
PrimePyBASIC is a port of PyBasic (see https://github.com/richpl/PyBasic) to the HP Prime with changes to support the Prime's MicroPython environment. It is also packaged as an HP Prime application for easy installation on a virtual or physical Prime calculator.
Please see the PyBasic repository for details of the BASIC functionality implemented and examples included.
I have created a separate repository to potentially add Prime specific functionality whereas PyBasic intends to remain non-hardware specific.
