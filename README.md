# PrimePyBASIC
PyBasic ported and packaged to run on the HP Prime calculator using the HP Prime MicroPython environment.
# Installation
Download and unzip PrimePyBASIC and drag the PyBASIC.hpappdir folder to the HP Connectivity Kit Content window (bottom left). Start your virtual Prime calculator or physically connect and power on your physical Prime calculator. Once the calculator appears in the HP Connectivity Kit, drag PyBASIC.hpappdir from the Content window to the calculator you wish to install to.
Note, to run large programs (including many of the example games) you will need to increase the PyBASIC heap size from 1Mb to 4Mb.

# References
PrimePyBASIC is a port of PyBasic (see https://github.com/richpl/PyBasic) to the HP Prime with changes to support the Prime's MicroPython environment. It is also packaged as an HP Prime application for easy installation on a virtual or physical Prime calculator.
Please see the PyBasic repository for details of the BASIC functionality implemented and examples included.
I have created a separate repository to potentially add Prime specific functionality whereas PyBasic intends to remain non-hardware specific.
